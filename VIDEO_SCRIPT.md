## BACKUP SCRIPT (If Technical Issues)

If the live demo has issues during recording:

1. **Use screenshots** - Create slide deck with screenshots
2. **Screen recording** - Pre-record interactions, add voiceover later
3. **Animation** - Use Loom or similar to record with face camera
4. **Split recording** - Record audio separately, sync in editing

**Remember:** Content matters more than perfect delivery. Show the innovation!
